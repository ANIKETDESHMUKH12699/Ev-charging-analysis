# Ev-charging-analysis
Global EV charging behavior and station usage analysis project.
This project analyzes the usage patterns, performance, and geographical distribution of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations. With the rapid adoption of electric mobility, the goal is to derive insights into station utilization, peak charging times, regional demands, and infrastructure gaps to support strategic planning for EV ecosystem development.

Objectives:
To analyze usage trends and performance metrics of EV charging stations.

To identify peak hours and most used stations.

To assess geographical gaps in charging infrastructure.

To recommend optimal locations for new EV stations based on demand.

To study user behavior such as charging duration, frequency, and energy consumption.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python / R

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn

Visualization: Power BI / Tableau / Python Dashboards

Geospatial Analysis: GeoPandas, Folium

Data Sources: Government open data portals, private EV providers (e.g., ChargePoint, Ather, Tata Power EV), Kaggle

Key Steps in the Project:
1. Data Collection:
Acquired datasets from government EV portals or charging network providers.

Included fields like charging station ID, location (lat-long), charger type (fast/slow), start and end time, kWh consumed, and user sessions.

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Removed null or duplicate entries.

Parsed and formatted timestamps.

Derived new columns such as charging duration, average energy consumption per session.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed usage patterns (daily, weekly, monthly).

Compared charger types (fast vs slow) in terms of utilization.

Calculated average charging time and energy usage per session.

Identified top-performing and underutilized stations.

4. Geospatial Analysis:
Mapped current station locations using GPS data.

Visualized station density across regions/states/cities.

Identified areas with high EV adoption but low infrastructure coverage.

5. User Behavior Analysis:
Studied frequency of visits per user (if user data was available).

Clustered users based on usage patterns (e.g., daily commuters vs long-distance users).

Analyzed energy consumption trends across time of day and season.

6. Predictive Modeling (Optional):
Forecasted demand for EV charging by time and location.

Suggested optimal station placement using clustering algorithms like K-Means.

Predicted station overload risks based on current growth trends.

Findings & Insights:
Urban centers like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru had the highest usage of fast chargers.

Charging peaks were observed between 8–10 AM and 6–8 PM.

Some stations in rural or poorly connected areas were underutilized.
